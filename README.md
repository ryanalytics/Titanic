# Titanic
Code for Kaggle Titanic Competition 

TitanicDataCleanup.py is used for cleaning the data in both test.csv and train.csv. Those two will become TestClean.csv and TrainClean.csv.

Titanic.R is then used to visualize and examine the data.

The final thing to use will be TitanicAnalysis.R. This is to build the model and make the final predictions. This made Result.csv and Results.csv which were two different submissions I made.
